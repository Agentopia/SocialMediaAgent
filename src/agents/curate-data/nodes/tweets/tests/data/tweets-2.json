The Brutalist used some form of technology to help them tell a story you like. So what? Being mad because a movie used AI is like being mad because a movie used practical or digital effects. It's as if it somehow invalidates the entire creative process, as if the filmmakers just pressed a button and went home.\n\nThe reality of filmmaking is messier, harder, and more interesting than that. Movies are elaborate magic tricks, using whatever tools can help create the illusion. Digital effects, practical effects, now neural networks. They're all just different ways to make the audience believe in something that isn't there. The only difference now is that we're calling it AI instead of \"digital tools.\"\n\nIf you are mad because \"AI was used in a movie,\" you will get really mad when you learn about crowd simulation, background generation, automatic color grading, noise reduction, facial and body motion capture, and many other things that use scary AI to make all the things you love. Being angry about AI in films is like being angry about cameras having autofocus. It's missing the point of what makes movies work in the first place. Tools don't make movies. People do."

I think if you believe that OpenAI has any idea what they are doing (they do), then they do not need to resort these sort of methods. \n\nThe part that I don't get is why must the arrangement be kept a secret till after o3 was released? Doesn't make much sense to me since everyone could guess that OpenAI was doing a successor to o1, providing funding for a new challenging benchmark is good PR\n\nhttps://t.co/odPkUsRlIC"
