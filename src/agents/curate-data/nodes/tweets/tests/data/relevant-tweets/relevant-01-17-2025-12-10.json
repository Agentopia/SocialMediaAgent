      "text": "spent the last month building my own framework to train a diffusion model from scratch.  it was hard\n\nalmost like i just learned to cast an ancient spell that requires lots of mysterious steps and ingredients.  for a long time i was trying, and nothing happened.  but when it worked it felt like magic\n\ni've learned a lot so wanted to share a bit 🧵\n\n- i'm doing *conditional* diffusion, trying to produce outputs x that depend on some inputs y.  my biggest blocker was that the architectural biases matter here –  you can NOT put the conditioning directly into the input, or the model will just learn to map y to x instead of using y to denoise the noisy input x. (the loss will go down but sampling will not work)\n- thus the diffusion world has a zoo of \"conditional\" architectures that can be a little challenging to adapt for your problem. but you have to use one or else things just won't work\n- apparently, architecture still matters in vision (sad).   initialization, residuals, and extra normalization can make all the difference\n- learning a small \"probe\" alongside your diffusion model is hugely valuable.  you can just cut the gradients to the probe so that it doesn't affect training.  this way you will know when you beat the baseline.  (i'm not sure if this is common practice but it was invaluable for me)\n- you need to incorporate sampling into training every-so-often. otherwise you will never figure out why your model doesn't work\n- the normalization is super important.  your input data needs to have ~mean 0 or std 1.  otherwise learning might not work,  or will be super slow\n- in diffusion a lot of things can have the same shape but be different \"types\" in the sense that they're incompatible in some way.  easy to make these bugs and the code will still run.  and you often can find them by checking that the norms, stds, and means are approximately correct\n- complex systems that you write from scratch will inevitably have tons of bugs.  you can start with trying to learn the identity function (in diffusion just set the noise to zeros).  if you can't do this something is broken.  in my case this helped me realize one of my losses had a sign flipped\n- in my opinion the loss after 1000 steps or so is usually a reliable signal for debugging architectural changes\n- diffusion people look down on DDPM as old and outdated but turns out it's still \"good enough for government work\" and worked fine for me eventually\n- wouldn't recommend the diffusers library.  not sure it's really being developed anymore.  heard the openai impl is much better\n- in general building systems from scratch is a slow and frustrating way to do research and i would recommend most people just start with a good codebase and tweaking it to fit your problem.  but if you build everything yourself you will learn a lot and feel a deep sense of satisfaction when it all starts working :)"

      "text": "I’ve spent a LOT of time thinking about this problem.\n\nAt first, I believed that reasoning models like O1 would be limited to solving problems for which we already know the solutions. This assumption was based on the idea that these models are trained on problems with verifiable answers, such as those found in math or coding.\n\nHowever, I’ve come to realize this perspective was incomplete. Reasoning models don’t memorize solutions - they learn methods and algorithms for approaching problems. This capability allows them to address unsolved problems using existing methodologies, even if humans haven’t yet solved those problems. For this to happen, the models need the freedom to explore the problem space creatively. They must generate diverse outputs and avoid being overly constrained by current knowledge or assumptions. I believe this freedom to explore is also why TTC models excel on benchmarks like AidanBench.\n\nAs I thought more deeply about this, I began categorizing unsolved problems into two groups:\n1. Problems where we already possess the necessary mathematical tools but haven’t yet discovered the solution.\n2. Problems that require the invention of entirely new mathematical tools, such as developing calculus or creating a novel branch of mathematics.\n\nIt now seems clear to me that reasoning models should be well-suited to solving problems in the first category.\n\nHowever, I’m much less confident about their ability to tackle problems in the second category. Making the creative leaps necessary to invent entirely new tools feels like a fundamentally different challenge that requires better architectures.\n\nThat said, large-scale reinforcement learning and search methods could potentially push these models toward developing more general or fundamental approaches for type 1 problems. Such advancements might also lead to insights that bridge the gap to type 2 problems. For example, if a particular method used for a type 2 problem also proves useful for a simpler type 1 problem (where we already know the answer), reasoning models might generalize/grok the solution to the type 1 problem in a way that uncovers insights applicable to the type 2 problem.\n\nThis process mirrors breakthroughs in physics, where unified or more general approaches - such as the Lagrangian, General Relativity, QM or the Path Integral reveal deeper connections and can be applied to simpler problems, to solve them in a shorter and more elegant way.\n\nEven if type 2 problems remain unsolved the space of type 1 problems is HUGE. Making these problems efficiently solvable in the near future would be a monumental achievement.\n\nI see this test-time-compute self-distillation paradigm mainly as an easy way to decrease the cost of solving (already solved problems and) type 1 problems."

If you're in editorial, art direction, pre-vis, brand development, production, etc., this model is for you.\n- The prompting system has been designed for precision and depth. It may take some initial exploration to master it. The more precise your input, the more nuanced your results will be.\n- Frames excels in understanding the subtleties that define good work: advanced texture rendering, natural lighting behavior, and thoughtful/interesting compositions. A big move beyond the rigid, symmetrical outputs you might be used to. Frames creates more naturalistic, cinematically composed results.\n- Frames has been optimized for creative exploration and artistic discovery, producing more nuanced and interesting creative results.\n- The model has been developed in close collaboration with our Studio team, ensuring it meets real-world professional standards.\n- This is our first public release of Frames. This is Frames v1. We have a clear roadmap for future developments, including enhanced controllability features and expanded style tools.\n- If you have any notes or feedback points, we would love to hear them."

This was way before it became a big deal with o1. But honestly, the scaling isn’t that impressive since adding more denoising steps stops making much of a difference pretty quickly – sry but it's a disappointing scaling law :(\n\nPeople have played with the randomness in diffusion models at test time and found that using good noises can improve the quality for various tasks. In this new work, we focus on a systematic exploration of inference-time scaling of diffusion models with a general search framework.\n\nWe take the idea of verifiers from large language models and demonstrate that different search algorithms can help find better noise candidates, preventing the scaling from hitting a ceiling during testing. By looking at inference-time scaling, we also highlight the trade-offs between different verifiers and discover new insights about evaluating diffusion models.\n\nDefinitely check out Wills @ma_nanye's thread below!",

      "text": "Crazy new feature in Triton \n\nBasically, Warp specialization in Triton takes advantage of the GPU’s hardware-level concurrency by splitting your kernel into multiple asynchronous tasks (“warp groups”). \n\nEach warp group runs in parallel—communicating efficiently via H100’s fast shared memory. \n\nYou enable this magic by setting a couple of autotune flags, such as num_consumer_groups and num_buffers_warp_spec. Under the hood, Triton now **automatically** schedules these warp groups to run concurrently, squeezing more performance out of the GPU.\n\nIn the example above (a warp-specialized matrix multiplication), you see how they do standard Triton steps—loop over chunks of K, load A/B blocks, compute partial results, and then write them back. \n\nThe key difference is the triton.Config specifying warp specialization parameters (like num_consumer_groups=2 and num_buffers_warp_spec=3). \n\nThat’s it: Triton handles splitting and overlapping work so that each warp group can make better use of GPU resources."
