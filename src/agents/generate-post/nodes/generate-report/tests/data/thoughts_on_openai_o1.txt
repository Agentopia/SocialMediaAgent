Thoughts on openai o1?
Despite the fact that the performance of the model(reasoning) has been boosted by 78%, I still believe there'll only be a super-hype about it for few weeks, some anxiety crises, non-technicals arguing about how fast programmers'll be gone so on and so far. Then, we'll be back to reality with lots of architectural issues and only surface level help or coding assistance by o1 nothing more. 

Wdyt?

The truth of the matter is, AI is only as good as the operator. And that appears to be the trajectory we're continuing. Data engineering isn't just about writing code. It's about understanding and handling all of the little nuanced issues that come up when trying answer seemingly simply questions. How many people truly even understand what a semantic layer is, let alone why you would even dream about having one???


I think a good AI can help provide an engineer, analyst, or scientist with the information they need to boot strap their dev processes, but I don't think a person who doesn't understand data will ever truly be able to harness the power of it.

ksco92: I’ve been hearing that “self serve analytics” bs for the past 10 years. Always fails. Actual users don’t know how to use the data for real. 20 people make the same metric differently and hundreds of business hours lost figuring out differences in calculations and queries. It always ends in DEs going back to owning everything.

Data_cruncher: I think r/PowerBI would disagree. I’ve rolled out literally hundreds of successful self-service BI projects - it’s not hard if you use semantic models.

TripleBogeyBandit: I wouldn’t say it replaces data engineers, but BI folks. Why pay a whole BI department when you could query AI with a backend. Look at what Databricks is doing with some of their offerings. As a customer, it’s very impressive.

Nwengbartender: They’ll still need people to hand hold them through the basics of what they actually need though. There’s so many basic concepts of data that people don’t understand and the embedded BI team might not be about pumping out reports but they’ll evolve into more of a guide, trainer, point of contact to help an area of the business.

compulsive_tremolo: Building out a concise yet comprehensive layer of  visuals to distill business-critical information is not a trivial task. It's been possible to spit out an automatic generation of graphs and charts for years before LLMs.

MathmoKiwi: &gt; The truth of the matter is, AI is only as good as the operator. 

This is so true. Just look at the past to see how true this is, with Google and the internet everyone has all the world's info at their fingertips. 

Yet it's shocking just how *incredibly bad* people's Googling techniques are (or even worse, they don't even *try* to google it). 

Rather than Google and the internet in general helping close the gap between the Average Joe and super geek need who has memorized an entire encyclopaedia, I reckon it has only even further increased the gap between those who can do this vs the rest of them.

I expect we'll see more of the same with LLMs, those who fully master leveraging their powers will just increase the gap of their productivity vs everyone else. But LLMs won't be outright eliminating their jobs, because so many will barely be able to use it intelligently.

big_data_mike: Exactly. AI is only as good as what people can think of. I was working on a problem today that was really hard. I’m essentially trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. At first the problem seems easy but then you start doing it and it’s like holy fuck which is the least shitty scenario. And it takes someone with domain knowledge like me to figure it out.

srodinger18: I have tried to build GenAI app that supposedly act as a fancy self serve analytics layer to the business user, and no matter how complex the AI build by the DS and MLE team, thebAI capabilities still cannot replace DE or even good BI/DA who have deep knowledge about business process behind the data.
seaefjaye: I had to tackle some basic code stuff and some strategy stuff and the responses are definitely of higher quality compared to 4o. I haven't had a chance to validate the code, but it seemed to be on the right track and was delivered with more documentation and explanation that it does without seeding/prompting it. The strategy stuff was more detailed as well, I'll give it a deeper review tomorrow but it definitely feels stronger.

byteuser: I noticed that too. Specifically when I tried a coding problem with both o1 and 4o both got stuck. But when I gave them a hint 1o knew how to solve it, like it read my mind. In contrast 4o remained stuck

Temporary_Quit_4648: If you haven't validated it, then your opinion is meaningless. LLMs' most notorious weakness is their ability to present highly convincing answers that are thoroughly and utterly wrong.

Rus_s13: Lots don't, but I've been preferring Claude of late. It's like having both a principal engineer with Alzheimer's and a gun junior at my disposal.

seaborn_as_sns: Eagerly awaiting GPT-5 with my hopes for significant improvement diminishing rapidly. 

OpenAI has no moat. Especially now with its lead researchers leaving in droves. 

o1 will be yet another disappointment.
zazzersmel: im still out here googling and reading content directly. none of these services have convinced me they offer any advantage.

not saying they cant be useful, but for what use case? saving 30 seconds on a simple problem? building a service on top to then sell to someone else? what else?

i really cant believe that the killer app the market has been waiting for is plethora of shitty CRUD apps that can be generated really quickly.

sl00k: &gt;not saying they cant be useful, but for what use case? saving 30 seconds on a simple problem?

For me, saving 30-120 seconds on 10 different relatively simple problems. It really adds up over time and it reduces a lot of brainpower needed for relatively needless repetitive problems.

Equivalent-Same: No silver bullet
byteuser: I did a side by side comparison between o1 and 4o for solving a coding problem of medium level difficulty. Same prompts. Both failed. But when I gave both a hint of how to solve the problem o1 immediately understood and solved it. Like it read my mind. Whereas 4o remained stuck. So, it is far from perfect but for coding at least it seems like a big step on the right direction

immerwasser: Can you share what sort of challenge (and hint) it was?
Nexyboye: i think it is a huge improvement, with this iterative thinking mechanism they should be able to make smaller models than before with the same accuracy. Also it might be the best way to combine a diffusion model and an LLM together into a single omni model. So fucking lovely!
ithoughtful: The time it takes to answer (busy thinking!) makes you think the output is much better. The model is "Thinking fast and slow"!
Fr_kzd: Honestly, it's basically feels like just 4o with wrapper functionalities. I'd imagine the process looks something like an internal multi prompt - multi response loop that simulates a train of thought, that's why it's more expensive. Also, this is why there is a new type of token within the response called 'reasoning tokens' which add to the final cost of prompting. It's honestly underwhelming. It's better than raw 4o, but I have a better implementation of this "train of thought" style architecture specifically designed for my use case (using 4o-mini), and it's cheaper to run. 60$ for 1M tokens is absurd.
tamhamspam: So one way to look beyond the hype is by understanding the model on a technical level. All the explanation videos so far haven’t been good, but THIS one is the best one I’ve found so far. She's an actual machine learning engineer and breaks down o1 really well. Basically putting the "open" back in OpenAI LOL
