If you're in editorial, art direction, pre-vis, brand development, production, etc., this model is for you.\n- The prompting system has been designed for precision and depth. It may take some initial exploration to master it. The more precise your input, the more nuanced your results will be.\n- Frames excels in understanding the subtleties that define good work: advanced texture rendering, natural lighting behavior, and thoughtful/interesting compositions. A big move beyond the rigid, symmetrical outputs you might be used to. Frames creates more naturalistic, cinematically composed results.\n- Frames has been optimized for creative exploration and artistic discovery, producing more nuanced and interesting creative results.\n- The model has been developed in close collaboration with our Studio team, ensuring it meets real-world professional standards.\n- This is our first public release of Frames. This is Frames v1. We have a clear roadmap for future developments, including enhanced controllability features and expanded style tools.\n- If you have any notes or feedback points, we would love to hear them.",

Around the time he left OpenAI, he shared with me his vision for an alternative research approach to AGI. I encouraged him to flesh out his ideas into an essay, which he drafted but tragically did not have the chance to complete. The premise: intelligence *is* data efficiency - and we can do much better than the current paradigm of scaling autoregressive models.\n\nI'm sharing his essay draft below in its original form. As we in the ML community work to improve and benchmark data efficiency, let's keep Suchir's contributions in mind, and honor his legacy as a brave, creative, and fiercely independent researcher.\n\nSuchir was our first summer intern at my previous startup, where he did outstanding work on real-time video understanding.

This was way before it became a big deal with¬†o1. But honestly, the scaling isn‚Äôt that impressive since adding more denoising steps stops making much of a difference pretty quickly ‚Äì sry but it's a disappointing scaling law :(\n\nPeople have played with the randomness in diffusion models at test¬†time and found that using good noises can improve the quality for various tasks. In this new work, we focus on a systematic¬†exploration of inference-time scaling of diffusion models with a general search framework.\n\nWe take the idea of verifiers from large language models and demonstrate that different search algorithms can help find better noise candidates, preventing the scaling from hitting a ceiling during testing. By looking at inference-time scaling, we also highlight the trade-offs between different verifiers and discover new insights about evaluating diffusion models.\n\nDefinitely check out Wills @ma_nanye's thread below!",

Under the hood, Triton now **automatically** schedules these warp groups to run concurrently, squeezing more performance out of the GPU.\n\nIn the example above (a warp-specialized matrix multiplication), you see how they do standard Triton steps‚Äîloop over chunks of K, load A/B blocks, compute partial results, and then write them back. \n\nThe key difference is the triton.Config specifying warp specialization parameters (like num_consumer_groups=2 and num_buffers_warp_spec=3). \n\nThat‚Äôs it: Triton handles splitting and overlapping work so that each warp group can make better use of GPU resources.",

Naive text-to-cypher\n2. Text-to-cypher with retry and evaluation\n3. Iterative planning system by generating a plan of sub-queries before creating the final query.\n\nAll of these can be stitched together as an event-driven system with @llama_index workflows. \n\nCheck out the post! https://t.co/n86ikA0Uti\n\nIf you want to get your hands dirty on workflows check out our guide here: https://t.co/tNolgSm48v",
